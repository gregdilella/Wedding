As they approached thier favourite spot, Greg's heart pounded with a mix of excitement and nervous anticipation. With a deep breath, he turned to her, the love of his life, and with words woven from the bottom of his heart, he proposed. Unbeknownst to her, their friends were discreetly nestled behind trees and bushes like skillful ninjas, cameras at the ready, capturing the moment of her surprise.""")
